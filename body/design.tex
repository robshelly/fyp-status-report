\section{Design}
	\subsection{System Architecture Overview}
		The system will comprise of three main components:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Management Server
			\item User Interface
			\item Disposable instances/containers
		\end{itemize}
		The system will also use existing ECS instances i.e  where backups are stored. Depending on the user of the system there may be multiple backup servers in different location (such as AWS regions) or for different data types (relational and non-relational databases).

		\end{figure}
		
		\noindent \textbf{Management Server:} This will be a small low cost AWS instance on which the Jenkins automation server will be installed. The majority of the systems functionality will be carried out and/or orchestrated by this server. Jenkins jobs will copy the backups from their location to a disposable instance and implement the necessary steps to validate them such as importing and and reading.
		
		\noindent \textbf{User Interface:} This will provide a simple user interface (UI) for the system, implemented as a simple web app, hosted on AWS.It will allow users with little knowledge of Jenkins and AWS to perform backup restoration checks by adding a layer of abstraction. Users will be able to run restorations by providing the parameters such as the backup file and it's location. The UI will utilise the Jenkins API to run execute the restoration with the parameters provided.
		
		\noindent\textbf{Disposable Instances:} Disposable infrastructure will be used to perform the restoration. This will consist of EC2 instances running the necessary DBMS to perform the restoration. They can also be destroyed afterwards, destroying the data and therefore maintaining confidentiality.

	\subsection{Formal Modelling}
	\subsubsection{Sequence Diagrams}
		The main function of the systems have been demonstrated below in sequence diagrams. \autoref{fig:seq-run-restore} shows the process of running a single backup restore. This involves a user manually triggering a restoration using the web interface. This triggers a Jenkins job which automates the remaining steps:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Backup copied to \textit{restoration} server;
			\item Backup decrypted;
			\item Backup import into DBMS;
			\item Data read from DB;
		\end{enumerate}
		Upon completion the \textit{restoration} server is terminated.

		\autoref{fig:seq-schedule-restore} shows the process of a scheduling regular backup restoration tests. Again, this is triggered by a user from the web interface. The web interface will pass the JSON or XML configuration for a job to the Jenkins server. The server verify the backup server exists before creating the job.
		
		\autoref{fig:seq-delete-restore} Show the process of deleting an existing scheduled job. The user triggers this process from the web interface. This sends a delete commands to the Jenkins server via the API to remove the schedule job. The status of the command, indicating a successful or failed restore, is returned to the user.

	\subsubsection{User Stories} \label{user-stories}
    
    \note[id=RB]{The expanded user stories in Table 1 look good. The table appears to overlap the page number.}
    
		User stories are provided in \autoref{table:user-stories}. Two types of system users and their privileges are described below;
		
		\textbf{Managers} control security aspects of the system:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Add and remove regular users;
			\item Manage SSH keys and decryption keys.
		\end{itemize}
		\textbf{Regular Users} will perform the day-to-day tasks of the system:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Perform resorations;
			\item Schedule restorations;
			\item View restoration results;
		\end{itemize}
